        "desc": "\"Ulysses Supercomputer\" draws on recent studies of the early twentieth century as a prefiguration of the contemporary digital age to develop a novel interpretation of Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em> and early cubist collage. I argue that both artists' use of the newspaper as a device indicates a commitment to an aleatory aesthetic that nonetheless remains grounded in social context. I conclude by suggesting that this conception of \"social combinatorics\" might be valuable for for interpreting the output of today's large language models.",

        "desc": "\"Drama, Life, and Stephen Dedalus\" traces Joyce's presentation of his literary surrogate from <em>Stephen Hero</em> to <em>Ulysses</em>, with particular attention to his tendency to see the world in aesthetic terms. Although the early Joyce takes this proclivity to be admirable, I show that it becomes a farce in <em>A Portrait</em> and a tragedy in <em>Ulysses</em>.",
