# Select Technical Experience
## Dexcom Continuous Glucose Monitoring
- Software Validation & Verification Intern | | Summer 2023 | As an intern for DexCom, I automated critical elements of software testing infrastructure using Java, Kotlin, and JUnit by creating convenient interfaces for remote device interaction. I refactored existing code to support parallel testing on multiple devices through Github actions.
## Harmelin Media

I streamlined continuous integration/continuous delivery flows using Python and CodeDeploy to deploy applications on EC2.
## University of Pennsylvania Health System
- Data Science Intern | | Summer 2019 | As a data science intern, I created a Jupyter-based application for monitoring predictive model degradation. I leveraged libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib to diagnose potential weak points in existing models and guide the development of new models. I successfully containerized and integrated the system into the team's developer intranet frontend.
